    "    According to the scatter plot that I made that illustrates the percentage of positive words for each review, if we set an arbitrary threshold of 50%, meaning that we would equate a review as \"positive\" if the percentage of positive words is greater than 50% and the opposite of this being \"negative\", it appears that most of the reviews are positive. This is because the majority of the reviews are concentrated above the said arbitrary 50% threshold.\n",

    "\n",
    "    After reading through the 5 most and least positive reviews - excluding the reviews that were either 0% or 100% positive -it seems that the 5 least positive reviews are actually negative. This is due to the fact that when you evaluate the 5 least positive reviews holistically, these said reviews are actually complaints made by disgruntled customers stemming from the poor experience with their airbnb due to the abyssmal service provided by the airbnb staff. Some of the grievances include how the airbnb was overpriced, unsanitary, unsafe, mediocre at best, and unprofessional all around."

I could tell that this wasn't her first rodeo when it comes to renting out her space. She was really well prepared for guests and ready/willing to answer any questions we had. I also really enjoyed her sweet cats. The tiger/grey one was so sweet, almost dog-like. The room was cozy and comfy, there were an ample amount of fresh towels, and the water pressure in the shower was really nice. I would equate the neighborhood to Crown Heights/East Flatbush in Brooklyn -- not as clean as Brooklyn Heights, but not particularly dangerous. Easy access to the T. Cute, old home that I would highly recommend to friends.

From before I came till after I had left Duane was the most helpful host I could ever imagine, making my stay in Boston so much easier and more fun. I also felt at home at his place right away, hanging in his lovely sofa everyday after a long day. Everyday would start with his friendly question if I was ready for coffee and home baked bread and I would sit and look out his window looking at the beatiful view out at Boston from his window enjoying my breakfast greatly. With Duane's interest in how I was doing and all his help we became friends and I will remember my stay at Duane's as a wonderful thing about Boston. Also don't worry about the transportation into downtown, I stayed at Duane's place for almost two weeks and went into downtown everyday and it was really no problem. One last thing.. I always felt secure in the neighborhood, it was a cozy area. I would choose Duane's place if I should ever come back to Boston and I would highly recommend Staying at Duane's to anybody going to Boston.

They left detailed instructions for our stay, answered any questions we had,  and even left 2 bottles of wine for us to enjoy with our holiday dinners; such a thoughtful touch! They were just awesome; they kept in touch (via text messaging) to make sure that we were enjoying our stay and let us know they were available to immediately address any issue that may arise. The apartment was even better in person - super cute, clean, and comfy! It was also bigger than we thought it would be, with enough room for the 3 of us (me, my husband, and our adult son) to spend time together, but also for each of us to have our own space if desired. The apt had all the described amenities (2 flat-screen TVs, wireless internet, a fully-supplied kitchen, etc.). We all slept well; the beds were big, soft, and warm. The neighborhood was nice, very quiet with a suburban feel. This was our first experience with airbnb, and the bar has been set very high indeed! This was sooo much better than staying in a hotel. The apartment was absolutely perfect - literally a home away from home. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.

The photos are beautiful but reality does not do them justice, you really have to be there. The beds were super comfortable, the house very clean (smells amazing!). Jessica has a talent for interior decorating. Her carriage house is a warm and welcoming place to relax after touring the sites. Waking up to a yummy breakfast and gourmet coffee tops the list; especially when you can enjoy it on her sunny terrace.\n",

I had only arrived back in the States the night before and was not even aware of what was happening. Marguerite called us first thing in the morning to give us her report on the situation, well in time for us to cancel or postpone our trip. I was very grateful that she had been proactive, thus giving us the time to make our decision. Moreover, she was quick to reassure us that we would be refunded if we did decide to cancel and she would be glad to have us at a different time if we preferred. In the end, we decided to make the trip, but we spent the first night at an airport hotel, only getting to Marguerite's for the second night. (I should add that she took care of getting our refund to us promptly and even arranged with airbnb to give us a bonus coupon to use for our next airbnb stay somewhere! That was going above and beyond, and we really appreciated it!) When we finally did arrive at her place, we were quite enchanted by the hominess of our little basement flat. (Personally, I felt much happier in that cozy space than I had at the somewhat sterile hotel!) We had our own separate entrance and could come and go as we pleased without disturbing anyone. The windows in the main room looked out into the garden where tulips and forsythia were in glorious spring bloom! (My husband enjoyed sitting in the sunshine on the little patio in the corner of the garden where there were chairs and a table.) A bottle of wine and two goblets with a corkscrew were thoughtfully laid out on the marble-topped coffee table to welcome us when we first walked in. (My Facebook picture that day showed my husband raising his glass as he relaxed in the old-fashioned rocker next to the coffee table :) I was a wee bit concerned about the bed being a futon, but, in fact, it was super comfortable (and nicely made up with a pretty Americana quilt--with plenty of extra blankets and pillows handy.) We had our own full bathroom, closet and chest of drawers, a desk to work at, and Internet and a nice flat-screen TV that all worked just great. Marguerite was very welcoming in the mornings, preparing a nice breakfast for us. We really enjoyed chatting and getting to know her and discovered that we had many common interests. (I forgot to add that, after the wine, our first clue that we were going to like our hostess came as we perused the many fascinating books she had lining the walls of our apartment!) Marguerite's home is within easy walking distance of the subway (\"T\") and also of one of...</td><td>positive

I could tell that this wasn't her first rodeo when it comes to renting out her space. She was really well prepared for guests and ready/willing to answer any questions we had. I also really enjoyed her sweet cats. The tiger/grey one was so sweet, almost dog-like. The room was cozy and comfy, there were an ample amount of fresh towels, and the water pressure in the shower was really nice. I would equate the neighborhood to Crown Heights/East Flatbush in Brooklyn -- not as clean as Brooklyn Heights, but not particularly dangerous. Easy access to the T. Cute, old home that I would highly recommend to friends.

From before I came till after I had left Duane was the most helpful host I could ever imagine, making my stay in Boston so much easier and more fun. I also felt at home at his place right away, hanging in his lovely sofa everyday after a long day. Everyday would start with his friendly question if I was ready for coffee and home baked bread and I would sit and look out his window looking at the beatiful view out at Boston from his window enjoying my breakfast greatly. With Duane's interest in how I was doing and all his help we became friends and I will remember my stay at Duane's as a wonderful thing about Boston. Also don't worry about the transportation into downtown, I stayed at Duane's place for almost two weeks and went into downtown everyday and it was really no problem. One last thing.. I always felt secure in the neighborhood, it was a cozy area. I would choose Duane's place if I should ever come back to Boston and I would highly recommend Staying at Duane's to anybody going to Boston. The bottom line is that I would wish that a review like this could express how happy I was about staying at Duane's.

They left detailed instructions for our stay, answered any questions we had,  and even left 2 bottles of wine for us to enjoy with our holiday dinners; such a thoughtful touch! They were just awesome; they kept in touch (via text messaging) to make sure that we were enjoying our stay and let us know they were available to immediately address any issue that may arise. The apartment was even better in person - super cute, clean, and comfy! It was also bigger than we thought it would be, with enough room for the 3 of us (me, my husband, and our adult son) to spend time together, but also for each of us to have our own space if desired. The apt had all the described amenities (2 flat-screen TVs, wireless internet, a fully-supplied kitchen, etc.). We all slept well; the beds were big, soft, and warm. The neighborhood was nice, very quiet with a suburban feel. This was our first experience with airbnb, and the bar has been set very high indeed! This was sooo much better than staying in a hotel. The apartment was absolutely perfect - literally a home away from home. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.

The photos are beautiful but reality does not do them justice, you really have to be there. The beds were super comfortable, the house very clean (smells amazing!). Jessica has a talent for interior decorating. Her carriage house is a warm and welcoming place to relax after touring the sites. Waking up to a yummy breakfast and gourmet coffee tops the list; especially when you can enjoy it on her sunny terrace.\n",

I had only arrived back in the States the night before and was not even aware of what was happening. Marguerite called us first thing in the morning to give us her report on the situation, well in time for us to cancel or postpone our trip. I was very grateful that she had been proactive, thus giving us the time to make our decision. Moreover, she was quick to reassure us that we would be refunded if we did decide to cancel and she would be glad to have us at a different time if we preferred. In the end, we decided to make the trip, but we spent the first night at an airport hotel, only getting to Marguerite's for the second night. (I should add that she took care of getting our refund to us promptly and even arranged with airbnb to give us a bonus coupon to use for our next airbnb stay somewhere! That was going above and beyond, and we really appreciated it!) When we finally did arrive at her place, we were quite enchanted by the hominess of our little basement flat. (Personally, I felt much happier in that cozy space than I had at the somewhat sterile hotel!) We had our own separate entrance and could come and go as we pleased without disturbing anyone. The windows in the main room looked out into the garden where tulips and forsythia were in glorious spring bloom! (My husband enjoyed sitting in the sunshine on the little patio in the corner of the garden where there were chairs and a table.) A bottle of wine and two goblets with a corkscrew were thoughtfully laid out on the marble-topped coffee table to welcome us when we first walked in. (My Facebook picture that day showed my husband raising his glass as he relaxed in the old-fashioned rocker next to the coffee table :) I was a wee bit concerned about the bed being a futon, but, in fact, it was super comfortable (and nicely made up with a pretty Americana quilt--with plenty of extra blankets and pillows handy.) We had our own full bathroom, closet and chest of drawers, a desk to work at, and Internet and a nice flat-screen TV that all worked just great. Marguerite was very welcoming in the mornings, preparing a nice breakfast for us. We really enjoyed chatting and getting to know her and discovered that we had many common interests. (I forgot to add that, after the wine, our first clue that we were going to like our hostess came as we perused the many fascinating books she had lining the walls of our apartment!) Marguerite's home is within easy walking distance of the subway (\"T\") and also of one of... & positive

I could tell that this wasn't her first rodeo when it comes to renting out her space. She was really well prepared for guests and ready/willing to answer any questions we had. I also really enjoyed her sweet cats. The tiger/grey one was so sweet, almost dog-like. The room was cozy and comfy, there were an ample amount of fresh towels, and the water pressure in the shower was really nice. I would equate the neighborhood to Crown Heights/East Flatbush in Brooklyn -- not as clean as Brooklyn Heights, but not particularly dangerous. Easy access to the T. Cute, old home that I would highly recommend to friends.

From before I came till after I had left Duane was the most helpful host I could ever imagine, making my stay in Boston so much easier and more fun. I also felt at home at his place right away, hanging in his lovely sofa everyday after a long day. Everyday would start with his friendly question if I was ready for coffee and home baked bread and I would sit and look out his window looking at the beatiful view out at Boston from his window enjoying my breakfast greatly. With Duane's interest in how I was doing and all his help we became friends and I will remember my stay at Duane's as a wonderful thing about Boston. Also don't worry about the transportation into downtown, I stayed at Duane's place for almost two weeks and went into downtown everyday and it was really no problem. One last thing.. I always felt secure in the neighborhood, it was a cozy area. I would choose Duane's place if I should ever come back to Boston and I would highly recommend Staying at Duane's to anybody going to Boston. The bottom line is that I would wish that a review like this could express how happy I was about staying at Duane's.

They left detailed instructions for our stay, answered any questions we had,  and even left 2 bottles of wine for us to enjoy with our holiday dinners; such a thoughtful touch! They were just awesome; they kept in touch (via text messaging) to make sure that we were enjoying our stay and let us know they were available to immediately address any issue that may arise. The apartment was even better in person - super cute, clean, and comfy! It was also bigger than we thought it would be, with enough room for the 3 of us (me, my husband, and our adult son) to spend time together, but also for each of us to have our own space if desired. The apt had all the described amenities (2 flat-screen TVs, wireless internet, a fully-supplied kitchen, etc.). We all slept well; the beds were big, soft, and warm. The neighborhood was nice, very quiet with a suburban feel. This was our first experience with airbnb, and the bar has been set very high indeed! This was sooo much better than staying in a hotel. The apartment was absolutely perfect - literally a home away from home. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.

The photos are beautiful but reality does not do them justice, you really have to be there. The beds were super comfortable, the house very clean (smells amazing!). Jessica has a talent for interior decorating. Her carriage house is a warm and welcoming place to relax after touring the sites. Waking up to a yummy breakfast and gourmet coffee tops the list; especially when you can enjoy it on her sunny terrace.\n",

I had only arrived back in the States the night before and was not even aware of what was happening. Marguerite called us first thing in the morning to give us her report on the situation, well in time for us to cancel or postpone our trip. I was very grateful that she had been proactive, thus giving us the time to make our decision. Moreover, she was quick to reassure us that we would be refunded if we did decide to cancel and she would be glad to have us at a different time if we preferred. In the end, we decided to make the trip, but we spent the first night at an airport hotel, only getting to Marguerite's for the second night. (I should add that she took care of getting our refund to us promptly and even arranged with airbnb to give us a bonus coupon to use for our next airbnb stay somewhere! That was going above and beyond, and we really appreciated it!) When we finally did arrive at her place, we were quite enchanted by the hominess of our little basement flat. (Personally, I felt much happier in that cozy space than I had at the somewhat sterile hotel!) We had our own separate entrance and could come and go as we pleased without disturbing anyone. The windows in the main room looked out into the garden where tulips and forsythia were in glorious spring bloom! (My husband enjoyed sitting in the sunshine on the little patio in the corner of the garden where there were chairs and a table.) A bottle of wine and two goblets with a corkscrew were thoughtfully laid out on the marble-topped coffee table to welcome us when we first walked in. (My Facebook picture that day showed my husband raising his glass as he relaxed in the old-fashioned rocker next to the coffee table :) I was a wee bit concerned about the bed being a futon, but, in fact, it was super comfortable (and nicely made up with a pretty Americana quilt--with plenty of extra blankets and pillows handy.) We had our own full bathroom, closet and chest of drawers, a desk to work at, and Internet and a nice flat-screen TV that all worked just great. Marguerite was very welcoming in the mornings, preparing a nice breakfast for us. We really enjoyed chatting and getting to know her and discovered that we had many common interests. (I forgot to add that, after the wine, our first clue that we were going to like our hostess came as we perused the many fascinating books she had lining the walls of our apartment!)

       "1 Shelley was so nice and helpful. I could tell that this wasn't her first rodeo when it comes to renting out her space. She was really well prepared for guests and ready/willing to answer any questions we had. I also really enjoyed her sweet cats. The tiger/grey one was so sweet, almost dog-like. The room was cozy and comfy, there were an ample amount of fresh towels, and the water pressure in the shower was really nice. I would equate the neighborhood to Crown Heights/East Flatbush in Brooklyn -- not as clean as Brooklyn Heights, but not particularly dangerous. Easy access to the T. Cute, old home that I would highly recommend to friends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "2 I felt so lucky that I had chosen Duane's place every day of the two weeks I stayed at his place. From before I came till after I had left Duane was the most helpful host I could ever imagine, making my stay in Boston so much easier and more fun. I also felt at home at his place right away, hanging in his lovely sofa everyday after a long day. Everyday would start with his friendly question if I was ready for coffee and home baked bread and I would sit and look out his window looking at the beatiful view out at Boston from his window enjoying my breakfast greatly. With Duane's interest in how I was doing and all his help we became friends and I will remember my stay at Duane's as a wonderful thing about Boston. Also don't worry about the transportation into downtown, I stayed at Duane's place for almost two weeks and went into downtown everyday and it was really no problem. One last thing.. I always felt secure in the neighborhood, it was a cozy area. I would choose Duane's place if I should ever come back to Boston and I would highly recommend Staying at Duane's to anybody going to Boston. The bottom line is that I would wish that a review like this could express how happy I was about staying at Duane's.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3 Our hosts (Richard and Victoria) made us feel very welcome. They left detailed instructions for our stay, answered any questions we had,  and even left 2 bottles of wine for us to enjoy with our holiday dinners; such a thoughtful touch! They were just awesome; they kept in touch (via text messaging) to make sure that we were enjoying our stay and let us know they were available to immediately address any issue that may arise. The apartment was even better in person - super cute, clean, and comfy! It was also bigger than we thought it would be, with enough room for the 3 of us (me, my husband, and our adult son) to spend time together, but also for each of us to have our own space if desired. The apt had all the described amenities (2 flat-screen TVs, wireless internet, a fully-supplied kitchen, etc.). We all slept well; the beds were big, soft, and warm. The neighborhood was nice, very quiet with a suburban feel. This was our first experience with airbnb, and the bar has been set very high indeed! This was sooo much better than staying in a hotel. The apartment was absolutely perfect - literally a home away from home. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "4 Jessica's enchanting Oasis was even better than expected. The photos are beautiful but reality does not do them justice, you really have to be there. The beds were super comfortable, the house very clean (smells amazing!). Jessica has a talent for interior decorating. Her carriage house is a warm and welcoming place to relax after touring the sites. Waking up to a yummy breakfast and gourmet coffee tops the list; especially when you can enjoy it on her sunny terrace.\\nThe location was perfect.  It was easy to get around in order to visit all the hot spots in Boston. A 10 minute walk to the T train red line which will take you everywhere you want to go. \\nIt was everything we were looking for and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "5 My husband and I were booked to arrive at Marguerite's the very day after the shoot-out with the Boston Marathon bombers, while the younger brother was still at large and the whole city was basically in lock down! I had only arrived back in the States the night before and was not even aware of what was happening. Marguerite called us first thing in the morning to give us her report on the situation, well in time for us to cancel or postpone our trip. I was very grateful that she had been proactive, thus giving us the time to make our decision. Moreover, she was quick to reassure us that we would be refunded if we did decide to cancel and she would be glad to have us at a different time if we preferred. In the end, we decided to make the trip, but we spent the first night at an airport hotel, only getting to Marguerite's for the second night. (I should add that she took care of getting our refund to us promptly and even arranged with airbnb to give us a bonus coupon to use for our next airbnb stay somewhere! That was going above and beyond, and we really appreciated it!) When we finally did arrive at her place, we were quite enchanted by the hominess of our little basement flat. (Personally, I felt much happier in that cozy space than I had at the somewhat sterile hotel!) We had our own separate entrance and could come and go as we pleased without disturbing anyone. The windows in the main room looked out into the garden where tulips and forsythia were in glorious spring bloom! (My husband enjoyed sitting in the sunshine on the little patio in the corner of the garden where there were chairs and a table.) A bottle of wine and two goblets with a corkscrew were thoughtfully laid out on the marble-topped coffee table to welcome us when we first walked in. (My Facebook picture that day showed my husband raising his glass as he relaxed in the old-fashioned rocker next to the coffee table :) I was a wee bit concerned about the bed being a futon, but, in fact, it was super comfortable (and nicely made up with a pretty Americana quilt--with plenty of extra blankets and pillows handy.) We had our own full bathroom, closet and chest of drawers, a desk to work at, and Internet and a nice flat-screen TV that all worked just great. Marguerite was very welcoming in the mornings, preparing a nice breakfast for us. We really enjoyed chatting and getting to know her and discovered that we had many common interests. (I forgot to add that, after the wine, our first clue that we were going to like our hostess came as we perused the many fascinating books she had lining the walls of our apartment!)

The host did not even meet us, but left rather complicated instructions to access the keys to the apartment.  We did not meet the host at all during our stay, or even hear from him as to how we were getting on.  The apartment was somewhat shabby, and not really like the image indicated, as this only showed a small corner of one room.  The kitchen was tiny, and although quite well equipped, it badly needed redecoration and a good clean. In addition, the apartment backed onto a yard with three dumpsters, and on 4 occasions we were awakened early in the morning by the noise of the dumpsters being emptied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>16.66667                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

The two matress were disgusting and uncomfortable. The bathroom I can't explain it. In the fridge was some old food. Before we arrive we inform Sean that we would like to use the two beds. When we arrive, we dont find sheets for the seconf bed and we ask Sean what can we do, and he say we can go to find him somewhere and he can give us all what we need. This is service? The idea of Airbnb is \"feel like at home\", but here I can only say \"better go to the hostel/hotel\". I can't recommend it. If you read the comments from other peolple you find that a lot of them say the same like me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>16.66667                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

However I felt as though there was a discrepancy with the photos of the room and the actual room. The room was extremely dusty and dirty despite Michelle saying that the place is \"professionally cleaned\". I found quite a few dead bugs in the room that should've been cleaned up. There was also a lot of flies, spiders, and centipedes in the room. The sink and the tub was constantly plugged and the water would always fill up even as I was just brushing my teeth. There were brown stains on the bottom of the tub and the shower was extremely slow. I had to wash my hair by dumping buckets of water on my head. On top of the hygiene factor, I also found that the area was unsafe. Upon arrival I already saw a bunch of men under house arrest hanging around our area and they gave myself and my friend quite a hard time by following us around and catcalling us. This happened over the next few days - being followed and being called extremely nasty things. After some investigation, I also found that a man was shot/stabbed repeatedly just a few blocks away from Michelle's home. That made me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe, and I actually had to book a hotel for the last night. Although everyone's tolerance for hygiene and safety is different, I found it unbearable to stay even one more night at Michelle's home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>17.64706                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

It is like a hostel, with several single rooms and shared bathroom. Clean, but not much else. Bed and table are shaky. Good if you're on a tight budget and just need a cheap place to crash for a night. They're strict about check-out times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 20.00000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

The host did not even meet us, but left rather complicated instructions to access the keys to the apartment.  We did not meet the host at all during our stay, or even hear from him as to how we were getting on.  The apartment was somewhat shabby, and not really like the image indicated, as this only showed a small corner of one room.  The kitchen was tiny, and although quite well equipped, it badly needed redecoration and a good clean. In addition, the apartment backed onto a yard with three dumpsters, and on 4 occasions we were awakened early in the morning by the noise of the dumpsters being emptied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 16.66667                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

The two matress were disgusting and uncomfortable. The bathroom I can't explain it. In the fridge was some old food. Before we arrive we inform Sean that we would like to use the two beds. When we arrive, we dont find sheets for the seconf bed and we ask Sean what can we do, and he say we can go to find him somewhere and he can give us all what we need. This is service? The idea of Airbnb is \"feel like at home\", but here I can only say \"better go to the hostel/hotel\". I can't recommend it. If you read the comments from other peolple you find that a lot of them say the same like me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 16.66667                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

The heater made incredibly loud and awful sounds all night long. While I'm grateful it was turned on, I couldn't sleep at all because of the rattling and shrieking coming from the baseboard unit right next to the bed and in the nearby kitchen. \n",

I paid TWICE because I didn't want to stay there. & positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 21.42857                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

However I felt as though there was a discrepancy with the photos of the room and the actual room. The room was extremely dusty and dirty despite Michelle saying that the place is \"professionally cleaned\". I found quite a few dead bugs in the room that should've been cleaned up. There was also a lot of flies, spiders, and centipedes in the room. The sink and the tub was constantly plugged and the water would always fill up even as I was just brushing my teeth. There were brown stains on the bottom of the tub and the shower was extremely slow. I had to wash my hair by dumping buckets of water on my head. On top of the hygiene factor, I also found that the area was unsafe. Upon arrival I already saw a bunch of men under house arrest hanging around our area and they gave myself and my friend quite a hard time by following us around and catcalling us. This happened over the next few days - being followed and being called extremely nasty things. After some investigation, I also found that a man was shot/stabbed repeatedly just a few blocks away from Michelle's home. That made me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe, and I actually had to book a hotel for the last night. Although everyone's tolerance for hygiene and safety is different, I found it unbearable to stay even one more night at Michelle's home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 17.64706                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

It is like a hostel, with several single rooms and shared bathroom. Clean, but not much else. Bed and table are shaky. Good if you're on a tight budget and just need a cheap place to crash for a night. They're strict about check-out times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 20.00000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

The host did not even meet us, but left rather complicated instructions to access the keys to the apartment.  We did not meet the host at all during our stay, or even hear from him as to how we were getting on.  The apartment was somewhat shabby, and not really like the image indicated, as this only showed a small corner of one room.  The kitchen was tiny, and although quite well equipped, it badly needed redecoration and a good clean. In addition, the apartment backed onto a yard with three dumpsters, and on 4 occasions we were awakened early in the morning by the noise of the dumpsters being emptied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 16.66667                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

The two matress were disgusting and uncomfortable. The bathroom I can't explain it. In the fridge was some old food. Before we arrive we inform Sean that we would like to use the two beds. When we arrive, we dont find sheets for the seconf bed and we ask Sean what can we do, and he say we can go to find him somewhere and he can give us all what we need. This is service? The idea of Airbnb is \"feel like at home\", but here I can only say \"better go to the hostel/hotel\". I can't recommend it. If you read the comments from other peolple you find that a lot of them say the same like me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 16.66667                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

I paid TWICE because I didn't want to stay there. | positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 21.42857                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

However I felt as though there was a discrepancy with the photos of the room and the actual room. The room was extremely dusty and dirty despite Michelle saying that the place is \"professionally cleaned\". I found quite a few dead bugs in the room that should've been cleaned up. There was also a lot of flies, spiders, and centipedes in the room. The sink and the tub was constantly plugged and the water would always fill up even as I was just brushing my teeth. There were brown stains on the bottom of the tub and the shower was extremely slow. I had to wash my hair by dumping buckets of water on my head. On top of the hygiene factor, I also found that the area was unsafe. Upon arrival I already saw a bunch of men under house arrest hanging around our area and they gave myself and my friend quite a hard time by following us around and catcalling us. This happened over the next few days - being followed and being called extremely nasty things. After some investigation, I also found that a man was shot/stabbed repeatedly just a few blocks away from Michelle's home. That made me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe, and I actually had to book a hotel for the last night. Although everyone's tolerance for hygiene and safety is different, I found it unbearable to stay even one more night at Michelle's home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 17.64706                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

       "1 You get what you pay for and you don't pay much for this place. It is like a hostel, with several single rooms and shared bathroom. Clean, but not much else. Bed and table are shaky. Good if you're on a tight budget and just need a cheap place to crash for a night. They're strict about check-out times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "2 We were rather disappointed with this accommodatiion. The host did not even meet us, but left rather complicated instructions to access the keys to the apartment.  We did not meet the host at all during our stay, or even hear from him as to how we were getting on.  The apartment was somewhat shabby, and not really like the image indicated, as this only showed a small corner of one room.  The kitchen was tiny, and although quite well equipped, it badly needed redecoration and a good clean. In addition, the apartment backed onto a yard with three dumpsters, and on 4 occasions we were awakened early in the morning by the noise of the dumpsters being emptied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3 disgusting, disappointed, dirty. The two matress were disgusting and uncomfortable. The bathroom I can't explain it. In the fridge was some old food. Before we arrive we inform Sean that we would like to use the two beds. When we arrive, we dont find sheets for the seconf bed and we ask Sean what can we do, and he say we can go to find him somewhere and he can give us all what we need. This is service? The idea of Airbnb is \"feel like at home\", but here I can only say \"better go to the hostel/hotel\". I can't recommend it. If you read the comments from other peolple you find that a lot of them say the same like me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "4 This was the first time I've left a rental midway through a trip. I left and paid MORE to stay in a hotel. I wish I would have seen the most recent review at the time I booked this place (the review posted very recently and I book a couple months ago), because I never would have booked the stay.\\n\\nEverything in the previous review by Gang is 100 percent accurate. Bare in mind this language barrier, he's speaking to the sounds the heater made rather than the AC. The heater made incredibly loud and awful sounds all night long. While I'm grateful it was turned on, I couldn't sleep at all because of the rattling and shrieking coming from the baseboard unit right next to the bed and in the nearby kitchen. \\n\\nAlso, the lighting is completely off in the photos provided. The space is very dark. Additionally, there was salt from the recent snow tracked through the entire place and a bag of dirty laundry by the door. I was very uncomfortable with the idea that someone/a company was coming by to pick up this dirty laundry while I was there. I ended up carrying all of my luggage with me to a conference because I had no idea who had the keypad code to this place.\\n\\nThe bed is terribly uncomfortable and, for the current temperatures of 10 degrees at night, there is insufficient bedding available. You're told specifically in the host instructions not to take any additionally bedding from the closet... despite the THIN \"comforter\" provided. The bed is no better than a pull-out couch with a metal bar in your back.\\n\\nI was so uncomfortable and unhappy with this listing, I stayed one night and left the next day for a hotel. I paid TWICE because I didn't want to stay there.\n",
       "5 Michelle seemed like a lovely woman and I can see why people would enjoy her company. However I felt as though there was a discrepancy with the photos of the room and the actual room. The room was extremely dusty and dirty despite Michelle saying that the place is \"professionally cleaned\". I found quite a few dead bugs in the room that should've been cleaned up. There was also a lot of flies, spiders, and centipedes in the room. The sink and the tub was constantly plugged and the water would always fill up even as I was just brushing my teeth. There were brown stains on the bottom of the tub and the shower was extremely slow. I had to wash my hair by dumping buckets of water on my head. On top of the hygiene factor, I also found that the area was unsafe. Upon arrival I already saw a bunch of men under house arrest hanging around our area and they gave myself and my friend quite a hard time by following us around and catcalling us. This happened over the next few days - being followed and being called extremely nasty things. After some investigation, I also found that a man was shot/stabbed repeatedly just a few blocks away from Michelle's home. That made me feel extremely uncomfortable and unsafe, and I actually had to book a hotel for the last night. Although everyone's tolerance for hygiene and safety is different, I found it unbearable to stay even one more night at Michelle's home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
